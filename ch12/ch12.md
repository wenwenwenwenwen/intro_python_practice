## 玩轉資料
1. 建立mystery = \U0001f984的unicode字串，印出mystery及它的unicode名稱
    ```python
    >>> import unicodedata
    >>> mystery = '\U0001f984'
    >>> mystery
    '🦄'
    >>> unicodedata.name(mystery)
    'UNICORN FACE'
    >>>
    ```

2. 將1.的mystery使用utf-8編碼成bytes變數pop_bytes並印出
    ```python
    >>> pop_bytes = mystery.encode('utf-8')
    >>> pop_bytes
    b'\xf0\x9f\xa6\x84'
    >>>
    ```

3. 將pop_bytes解碼成pop_string並印出，是否等於mystery?是
    ```python
    >>> pop_string = pop_bytes.decode('utf-8')
    >>> pop_string
    '🦄'
    >>>
    ```

4. 將`Ode on the Mammoth Cheese`這首詩存進mammoth變數
    ```python
    mammoth = """We have seen the Queen of cheese,
    Laying quietly at your ease,
    Gently fanned by evening breeze,
    Thy fair form no flies dare seize.

    All gaily dressed soon you'll go
    To the great Provincial Show,
    To be admired by many a beau
    In the city of Toronto.

    Cows numerous as a swarm of bees,
    Or as the leaves upon the trees,
    It did require to make thee please,
    And stand unrivalled queen of cheese.

    May you not receive a scar as
    We have heard that Mr. Harris
    Intends to send you off as far as
    The great World's show at Paris.

    Of the youth beware of these,
    For some of them might rudely squeeze
    And bite your cheek; then songs or glees
    We could not sing o' queen of cheese.

    We'rt thou suspended from baloon,
    You'd cast a shade, even at noon,
    Folks would think it was the moon
    About to fall and crush them soon.
    """
    ```

5. 匯入re使用re.findall()印出c開頭的所有單字
    ```python
    >>> import re
    >>> re.findall(r'(?i)(?<![a-z])c[a-z]+', mammoth)
    ['cheese', 'city', 'Cows', 'cheese', 'cheek', 'could', 'cheese', 'cast', 'crush']
    >>>
    ```

6. 找出c開頭4個字母單字
    ```python
    >>> re.findall(r'(?i)(?<![a-z])c[a-z]{3}(?![a-z])', mammoth)
    ['city', 'Cows', 'cast']
    >>>
    ```

7. 找出r結尾的單字
    ```python
    >>> re.findall(r'(?i)(?<![a-z])[a-z]+r(?![a-z])', mammoth)
    ['your', 'fair', 'Or', 'scar', 'Mr', 'far', 'For', 'your', 'or']
    >>>
    ```

8. 尋找有連續3個母音的單字
    ```python
    >>> re.findall(r'(?i)[a-z]+[aeiou]{3}[a-z]+', mammoth)
    ['Queen', 'quietly', 'queen', 'squeeze', 'queen']
    >>>
    ```

9. 使用unhexlify把以下字串轉換成bytes變數gif，
    '47494638396101000100800000000000ffffff21f90401000000002c000000000100010000020144003b'
    ```python
    >>> import binascii
    >>> gif = binascii.unhexlify(b'47494638396101000100800000000000ffffff21f90401000000002c000000000100010000020144003b')
    >>>
    ```

10. gif的開頭是否為ascii字元GIF89a?
    ```python
    >>> gif[:6] == b'GIF89a'
    True
    >>>
    ```

11. gif是像素寬度16位元(2 bytes)的little-endian整數，從byte offset 6開始，高度的大小一樣，從offset 8開始，從gif取出並印出這些值
    ```python
    >>> struct.unpack('<HH', gif[6:10])
    (1, 1)
    >>>
    ```
